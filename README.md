# Competitive-Programming
In this repository I will upload all the coding solutions of different questions I have completed in various coding sites, which will include codechef, codeforces, atcoder, cses, Leetcode and UVA.

For those persons who are not familiar with enough CP, this repository will definitely boost of their problem solving skills.

Some of the website URLs on which you may find much more problems to solve other than the problems i had solved. These sites always have some contests going on so you can test your real skills among all coders around the globe.

Codechef - https://www.codechef.com/
Codeforces - https://codeforces.com/
leetcode - https://leetcode.com/
atcoder - https://atcoder.jp/
cses - https://cses.fi/problemset/

I will keep this repository always updated once in 1 month, so you can get an idea of solving different questions with some other approach. Also, all the questions might not been having the best approach, some of them can also be tricky, but just remember this part that you should atleast know some approach in your mind, whether or not it is going to give TLE (Time Limit Exceeded), because ony once you will think about the brute force solution only then you can optimize further.

Also, you guys also can contribute to my repository, it will be a pleasure of mine to seeing you guys to help others around the globe. Together we can do it all together.

For any problems or suggestions you can mail me at sparshgpt18@gmail.com .
